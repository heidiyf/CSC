\item[1.]
\begin{verbatim}
a3_part2.py::test_star_wars PASSED
a3_part2.py::test_legally_blonde FAILED
a3_part2.py::test_transformers FAILED
\end{verbatim}



\item[2.]
\begin{verbatim}
Error 1: It is in the function clean_text that converts text to lowercase.
After the function removes punctuation from the text, we want to convert the
text to lowercase letters and split the text into words. The problem with this code
is that it doesn't assign it back to text after it has been converted to lowercase.
Therefore, for the next line of code, we are still using the old text. This leads to a
problem: when we apply the count_keywords function, words with capital letters are
filtered out when we try to filter WORD_TO_INTENSITY.

Error 2: The second problem is in count_keywords. If we find a word that matches
WORD_TO_INTENSITY and is not already in dict, we should assign it with the dict index
and assign a value of 1. However, if the word already appears in the previous word,
we should simply add 1 to the original value of that corresponding key. the problem with
this code is that it assigns a value of 0 and then directly adds 1 to its value without
any mention of what happens when the function is already in the dict.
\end{verbatim}

\item[3.]
\begin{verbatim}
The reason why test_star_wars passes the test is that it does not address the problem
mentioned in the second question. Since all words match the WORD_TO_INTENSITY in the
review of Star Wars are fortunately lowercase, so the problem of case mismatch is not
touched; likewise, fortunately, each word in WORD_TO_INTENSITY appears only once, so
each word is a word that is not added to the dict, so the case of "if the word in
occurrences_so_far" is not involved.
